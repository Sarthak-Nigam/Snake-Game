This is a game created in Python. <br>
In this game there is a creature representing a snake which moves around and eats the food.
The food is randomly placed any where in the space & we have to give direction to the snake so it can reach the food particles.
As the snake eats the food its size grows by 1 block.
The snake dies if it goes out of the field and also it it grows long enough and hits its tail or body.
